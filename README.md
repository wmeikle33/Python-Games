# Python Games
This repository contains python games completed as part of the Udemy course, Python Zero to Hero. This represents some my very earliest work in Python. In some instances, an optimized version of the original code has been uploaded as well to show development.

## Repo Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```bash
.
├── src/            # Source code for the application
├── docs/           # Project documentation and guides
├── tests/           # Automated tests (unit, integration)
├── build/          # Compiled output files (usually excluded from git)
├── .github/        # GitHub specific configurations (workflows, templates)
├── LICENSE         # Project license file
└── README.md       # The main information file (this file)
```
